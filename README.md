About this Repo.:
--------------
Welcome to Pyctionary! As the name suggests, It's **Py**thon based Di**ctionary**. Trust me when you look at the code, you'll be suprised to see the amount of code. This is entirely dependent on NLTK package and it just works!

Now, if you wish to run as python code, be my guest! However the fun lies when you need to type less and do more.
If you are of such belief, then you just need to create a _.pyc_ file iut of the Python code and save it in your `/usr/bin/` directory. I'll be more decsriptive below.

As of now, I want you to go ahead and try out using regular `python pyctionary.py` way.
